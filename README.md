# facial-expression-detection
A Flask API which enables the user to visualize facial expressions by looking into the front camera of the device. The facial expressions are: angry, fear, sad, happy, neutral, surprise, and disgust. A self-trained Convolutional Neural Network was used to perform the classification.

## Requirements:
Tensorflow 2.0.0

Flask 

## About the data and Neural Network:
The dataset contained images of size 48 x 48 due to limitations on computational resources. If needed, a better dataset can be used with the model created in facial_expression.ipynb.
